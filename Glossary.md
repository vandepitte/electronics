# Glossary

**Fuses** Configuration parameters for microcontrollers. Setting wrong fuses
can lock you out of the programming process. Then you'll need HVSP

**HVSP** High Voltage Serial Programmer. 12V protocol to unlock a locked chip.

**ISP** In-circuit Serial Programmer. Device that connects to a specific set of pins of the microcontroller to perform the programming of the whole flash memory of the microcontroller, bootloader included (from: arduino.cc)

**MOSI** Master Out Slave In (data output from master). See SPI

**MISO** Master In Slave Out (data output from slave). See SPI

**SCK** Serial Clock. See SPI

**SPI** Serial Peripheral Interface. Synchronous serial communication interface specification / protocol. Is used as interface to 
program AVR microcontrollers.
