I'm a electronics hobbyist with very little background in electronics. I've been programming for more than 20 years in languages like Java, Python, C++, Perl, R, ... 
But since a while I've been bitten by the electronics/home automation virus. Not that I want to automate everything 
(I still think a simple manual switch is way more robust than an RF switch that sends a signal to a RF/MQTT bridge that sends a message to Home Assistant, that
sends a message to a smart light bulb) 
but it is just a lot of fun to program physical stuff.

Although there's a lot of useful information in the wild, I need some place to write down what I've learned in my own simple words. 
Not everything I've written is 100% theoretically correct, but it's good enough to support my understanding of the world of electronics.

This repo contains personal notes for my electronics projects.

* Projects contains recipes for my projects
* Howto contains more general guides to get started with stuff
